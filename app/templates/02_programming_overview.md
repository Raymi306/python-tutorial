# Programming is Simple
Programming is both a broad and a deep field; however, getting your foot in the door shouldn't be intimidating.

Programming is the act of telling a computer how to do things.

Any game that you play, computer tool that you use, app that you run - all programs that are and that could be require code somewhere in the toolchain.

With programming, you take data in, manipulate it, and put data back out. It is within these 3 non-mandatory(?) steps that lie the keys to harnessing the power of a computer.
These inputs can be key presses, text, or even arbitrary data.
The outputs could be text that you read, pretty (or not so pretty) graphics, more data in any shape or size.

I hope to use Python to show you that programming is simple. Anyone can learn it.
With patience, practice, and simple explanation, even the most steadfast skeptic can understand the basic building blocks of programming.
The trick lies in realizing that even complicated problems can be expressed through the utilization of these building blocks. Everything can be reduced back to the basics!

Once you've mastered the basics, you can explore the myriad tools that programming languages provide that allow you to express and solve problems in simpler, faster, or more beautiful ways.
