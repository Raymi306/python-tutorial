# Programming is Simple
What is programming?
It is, at its base, telling a computer how to do things.
But the anxiety creeps in when thinking about HOW to tell the computer these things.
There are many programming languages to choose from and styles of programming to consider, however, at least a few things remain constant.
You take data in.
Manipulate it.
And you put data out.
Let's quickly explore some of the building blocks universal to all useful programming languages:
## Variables
Already covered in early schooling, and they're actually more general in programming.
Just a label pointing at data for you to use as you see fit.
## Control flow
### Conditionals
---

Code executes top to bottom, start to finish, but sometimes that is inconvenient.
Sometimes, you need to make a decision based on whether a condition is true or false.
Once that decision is made, you choose a fork in your previously straight road to go down.
### Loops
---

Sometimes, you want to do a task forever.
Sometimes, you want to do a task a certain number of times.
And sometimes, you want to do a task until a condition is no longer true.
Even within these broad categories, there is already some overlap between concepts.
## Functions
Math-adverse folks might cringe at the mention of functions, but in programming, they are very easy to create and use.
Write some code, move it to its own place in the file, and give it a descriptive title.
In that title, you can declare if your code needs any data to work, and in the code, decide if you give anything back.
Now, you have some code that you can reuse anywhere you please.

Programming is both a broad and a deep field, but getting your foot in the door shouldn't be intimidating.
The basic concepts that you will apply and reapply with ANY programming language have already been explained above, in what are hopefully smaller, more approachable chunks..
Much of programming truly comes down to inputs and outputs.
Stuff goes in to the computer somewhere, and stuff comes out somewhere else.
These inputs can be key presses, a text file, or some other arbitrary data.
The outputs could be text that you read, pretty (or not so pretty) graphics, data in any shape or size.
Take data in, manipulate it in some way, put data out.
It's programming.
