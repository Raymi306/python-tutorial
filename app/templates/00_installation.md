# Installation
## Windows | [link to download page]({{ext_python_dl_page}})
Find the download link for the latest stable version of Python, and download it.
Once the download is complete, make sure to run the file.
A typical installer will guide you through the setup process, requiring little more than pressing 'Next'.
However, there are some options that it presents whose meaning might not be initially obvious.
Of the options presented, **ensure that you select the checkmark to add Python to the [path]({{misc_paths}}).**
## Linux
Linux distributions often come with a version of Python already installed.
It is worth checking the version on your system, this can be done with running `python3 -V` from the command line; If you would like to use a newer version, package managers often have several versions available.
For some package managers, you may need to add another source to retrieve versions not normally included in your distributions package manager.
Installing from source is also always an option.
Note that in this tutorial, you will need to mentally translate references to the `python` command `python3`; If you type just `python` there is a chance that you will be running the older Python 2 version.
