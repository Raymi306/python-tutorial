## Online Code Challenges: Codewars
[link]({{ext_codewars}})

A variety of code challenge websites and online judges exist.
Reading about coding is fine, but you HAVE to write code too.
These websites provide challenges that can be as simple as adding two numbers or as complex as solving
a mathematical puzzle. Codewars and several other comparable sites allow you to code directly in your browser,
click a button to run tests against your solution, and receive immediate feedback as to whether your solution is correct or not.
Once you have a working solution, you can also view other people's solutions, exposing you to how other people write code and
showing you tricks and sometimes even idiomatic approaches to problems.

A great way to transition between languages is to go to Codewars and select the simplest category of tasks,
this will expose you to the basic tools of the language, and viewing other people's solutions can be invaluable.
