## Online Code Challenges: Codewars
A variety of code challenge websites and online judges exist, one of which is [Codewars]({{ext_codewars}}).
Reading about coding is fine, but you HAVE to write code too.
These websites provide challenges that can be as simple as adding two numbers or as complex as solving
a mathematical puzzle. Codewars and several other comparable sites allow you to code directly in your browser,
click a button to run tests against your solution, and receive immediate feedback as to whether or not your solution is correct.
Once you have a working solution, you can view other people's solutions, exposing you to other people's code and
showing you tricks and sometimes even idiomatic approaches to problems. Once you know one language, it isn't as hard to learn the next one.
A great way to transition to a new language is to take advantage of Codewars' simpler tasks.
This helps you quickly familiarize yourself with a language's basics.
