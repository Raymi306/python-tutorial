# How to run code
## Interpreter
On Windows:
open up an interpreter (cmd or powershell)
type `python` and hit enter

On Linux:
open up an interpreter
type `python3` and hit enter

Inside the interpreter, you can type anything you like and Python will attempt to run it as code.
When you see the default prompt of '>>>' the interpreter is ready for you to type more things and hit enter.
If you see '. . .' the interpreter recognizes that you have begun a multiline statement and is expecting more input.
You can hit enter again to finish the multiline statement.

## File
Write the python code using a text editor of your choice.
When ready to run the code, make sure to save it.
Inside your interpreter, call the python executable and pass the path to your file as the argument.
It will run your file to completion.
Want to stop and look around? Add a line with `breakpoint()` and execution will stop, and you will be dropped into a debugger.
Here you can type variables to see their value. More on this later.
